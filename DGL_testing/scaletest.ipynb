There are many aspects (such as optimization and personal perception of theta) which will be required in future but are currently not utilized. With the model in its current arrangement, the agents stop trading and stabillize after ~7 time steps. I have included a commented-out section at the bottom which uses matplotlib pyplot if you wish to get a quick look.\n",
